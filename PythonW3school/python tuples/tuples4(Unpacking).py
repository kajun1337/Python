#When we create a tuple, we normally assign values to it. This is called "packing" a tuple:
meyveler = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
#But, in Python, we are also allowed to extract the values back into variables. This is called "unpacking":
(green,yellow,red) =  meyveler
print(green)
print(yellow)
print(red)
